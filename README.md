# ffmpeg-scripts

## Overview
This repository, "ffmpeg-scripts," contains a collection of batch scripts designed to simplify and automate various video processing tasks using FFmpeg. These scripts are particularly useful for batch video conversion, merging split video files, and leveraging GPU acceleration for efficient video processing.

## Scripts in This Repository

### 1. `convert-to-mp4.bat`
Converts `.mkv` files to `.mp4` format using FFmpeg. This script can be executed in any directory and will process all `.mkv` files within that directory.

### 2. `gpu-accelerated-conversion.bat`
Similar to `convert-to-mp4.bat`, but utilizes NVIDIA GPU acceleration for faster processing. Requires an NVIDIA GPU and appropriate drivers.

### 3. `merge-split-files.bat`
Merges video files that are split into parts (e.g., 'CD1' and 'CD2') into a single file. This script is designed to process files within the same directory and output a merged file with a custom name.

### 4. `merge-to-folder-name.bat`
An iteration of `merge-split-files.bat` that names the output file after the folder it resides in, providing a convenient way to organize merged files.

## Installation
1. **Install FFmpeg**: Ensure FFmpeg is installed on your system and added to your PATH.

# Usage
## General Usage
Place the desired script in the directory with your video files.
Double-click the script to run it.
For GPU-accelerated scripts, ensure you have a compatible NVIDIA GPU.
Specific Script Usage
- convert-to-mp4.bat:
Right-click on the script and select 'Run as administrator' to convert all `.mkv` files in the folder to `.mp4`.
- gpu-accelerated-conversion.bat:
Requires an NVIDIA GPU. Right-click and run as administrator to convert video files using GPU acceleration.
- merge-split-files.bat & merge-to-folder-name.bat:
- These scripts merge video files split into parts. Ensure the files are correctly named (e.g., 'CD1', 'CD2') before running.

# Disclaimer
- Always back up your video files before using these scripts.
